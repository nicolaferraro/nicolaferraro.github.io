It has been a pleasure to give a talk at JBCNConf, one of the biggest conferences about Java in Europe.

I've presented the work that we've been doing recently on reactive streams in Apache Camel, with a fancy introduction on the reactor 
pattern and a lot of reasoning on end-to-end backpressure.

I've been really happy to see my name in the **"top 10" of speakers** at the end of the conference.
I feel that people liked the way I presented things, but this is also a confirmation that the 
reactive topic is hot and Camel is going in the right direction.

The slides are available here:
