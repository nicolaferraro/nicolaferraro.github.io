I've presented Apache Camel at the last Kubecon EU conference that took place on August 19th, 2020.

As for many conferences this year, Kubecon EU was held online, not in the sunny Amsterdam as it was planned. No time to meet in person the developers that are making really good things in the Knative and Kubernetes space, but the 
talks were pretty awesome, and now everybody can [watch them for free on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj6h78yzYM2O1wlsM-Ma-RYhfT5LKq0XC).

I'm proud that Apache Camel was there, thanks to the hard work that all the team has been doing over the last two years, with the new Camel 3.x releases, Camel Quarkus and especially **Camel K** that bring all those features to Kubernetes.

The serverless space is an area where Camel K can make the difference. Camel K integration with Knative really rocks and we're working every day on improving it.

If you want to know what I'm talking about, why don't you listen it from myself?

As you'll learn from the video, many cool features are cooking in the pot. So, stay tuned!
