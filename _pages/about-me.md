I’m a senior software engineer at Red Hat, writing open source software for fun. They also pay me for that.

I'm a committer and PMC member for the [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel). I'm also working 
on the [Apache Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k) cloud native platform.

I work on the [Syndesis](https://syndesis.io) integration platform, based on Apache Camel.

I work on the development tools of [Fabric8](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8),
such as the [Fabric8 Maven Plugin](http://maven.fabric8.io) for building and running Java applications on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and [Openshift](https://github.com/openshift/).

I’m passionate about Apache Spark and wrote some libraries for it.

* [Spark-HBase-Connector](https://github.com/nerdammer/spark-hbase-connector): to let Spark interact with Apache HBase with ease.
* [Spash](https://github.com/nerdammer/spash): a Bash-like console to interact with a Big Data cluster.

I worked at Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. (Italy) before joining Red Hat. 
Last experience at Engineering was about leading a team of 20 developers to create a new MDM (Meter-Data-Management) system based on Apache Spark, 
HBase, Kafka and Hadoop.

I also own the following certifications:

* Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Web Services Developer
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Enterprise JavaBeans Developer
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Java Persistence API Developer
* Sun Certified Programmer for the Java Platform, SE 6
