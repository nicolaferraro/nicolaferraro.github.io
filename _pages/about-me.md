Iâ€™m a principal software engineer at Red Hat, writing open source software for fun. They also pay me for that.

I'm a committer and PMC member on [Apache Camel](https://github.com/apache/camel). I'm also co-author of 
[Apache Camel K](https://github.com/apache/camel-k): a lightweight platform for running Apache Camel integrations on Kubernetes and OpenShift 
that leverages Knative for "serverless" features.

I work also on the [Syndesis](https://syndesis.io) integration platform, based on Apache Camel.

I work on the development tools of [Fabric8](https://github.com/fabric8io/fabric8),
such as the [Fabric8 Maven Plugin](http://maven.fabric8.io) for building and running Java applications on [Kubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) and [Openshift](https://github.com/openshift/).

My full CV is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicolaferraro).
