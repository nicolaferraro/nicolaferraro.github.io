![Red Hat Logo](/images/red-hat-logo.png)

I’m a senior software engineer at Red Hat, writing open source software for fun. They also pay me for that.

I contribute particularly in projects related to JBoss Fuse: Apache Camel, Apache Karaf, Apache ActiveMQ, Fabric8, hawt.io, OpenShift.

I’m passionate about Apache Spark and wrote some libraries based on it.

* [Spark-HBase-Connector](https://github.com/nerdammer/spark-hbase-connector): to let Spark interact with Apache HBase with ease.
* [Spash](https://github.com/nerdammer/spash): a Bash-like console to interact with a Big Data cluster.

I worked at Engineering Ingegneria Informatica S.p.A. (Italy) before joining Red Hat. 
Last experience at Engineering was about leading a team of 20 developers to create a new MDM (Meter-Data-Management) system based on Apache Spark, 
HBase, Kafka and Hadoop.

I also own the following certifications:

* Oracle Certified Master, Java EE 6 Enterprise Architect
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Web Services Developer
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Enterprise JavaBeans Developer
* Oracle Certified Expert, Java EE 6 Java Persistence API Developer
* Sun Certified Programmer for the Java Platform, SE 6
