Apache Camel K is reaching its maturity with current 1.0.0-RC2 release, just one step away from 1.0.0.
We've been working hard in the past months to add awesome features to Camel K, but also to improve its stability
and performance. This post contains a list of cool stuff that you'll find in latest release.

First of all, if you're living under a rock and it's the first time you hear about Camel K, 
you can read some introductory blog posts here ([1](/2018/10/15/introducing-camel-k/), [2](/2018/10/15/camel-k-on-knative/))
or look at the [new Apache Camel website](https://camel.apache.org/) that contains a [Camel K section](https://camel.apache.org/camel-k/latest/)
with a lot of material that is automatically generated from the [Github repository](https://github.com/apache/camel-k).

## IDE integration



## Serverless

Serverless is the most important keyword FIXME when thinking to Camel K. Although you can have a wonderful Camel K experience
even without serverless features (e.g. if your cluster does not ship [Knative](https://knative.dev)), it's an area where we've
done a lot of improvements in recent months.



## Fast startup and low memory 

Camel 3.1.0
Quarkus

## Fast build times
